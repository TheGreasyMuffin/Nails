Project title: 
Nails 

Overview:
This website is for a business owner who is setting up a nail salon in the local area. The aim of the client would be to get customers in the door, and also create some 
bookings online so people don't have to come into store to make appointments. They want customers to be able to send in messages through the website, basically informing 
the business owner of what they want done and when. This would lead to the business owner giving the customer a call back just to make the whole process feel a bit more personal.
They want also for customers to be able to have a look at their portolio, too see the their professonial skill and boost sales.

UX:
This website is aimed at woman aged 17-45. Although this is a wide range, women of younger and older will also want the service but we can recognise that this will be the 
main bulk of the cosumers coming through the site. Baring this in mind you can't generally group the target market into one category of style as the range of consumers will 
be so wide. Based on this I have conducted some market reasearch into other websites with the same goal, also I have spoken to a few potential customers varying in age and 
background. 

User comments:
Client 1 "I would like to see an inviting and colourful site with photos to see what the works like" 
Client 2 "I would like to be able to see where the shop is located so I could go down and check it myself" 
Client 3 "I wanna see pictures of the work as I have been to a couple shops and not been satified with the outcome" 
client 4 "Personally I wanna be able see contact details so I can get in contact with the salon directly"
client 5 "I am constantly on social media so if the shop had online presence I would like to be able to look at it" 

I have come up with a basic wire frame idea based on these ideas. You can find this at <a href="../info/wireframe/wireframe-nails.pdf"></a>

Features:
Based on my UX research I believe I will need to include these features:-

-Fullscreen picture as the home page of a manicure. This will allow users to instantly know what the website is about and not be confused. 

-Links to social media at the footer of every page. This will allow users to navigate to social accounts and possible find out more information about the 
client more easily and effiently. 

-Scrolling (left-right) photo gallery showing off clients work. This will allow users to see the clients work without making the page look messy. It will 
also be easy for users to navigate through the photos.

-Contact form allowing users to give their names; contact number; email and a breif overview of what they want done or any questions they may have. This will allow
our client too not only get an idea of customers problems or queries but also make arranging appointments easier. 

-(not 100%$) Could include a map of where the shop is based although I'm not 100% I have the skills to this just a thought for later
